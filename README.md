# FIRESTICK
This is basically a modification to CVM's 1.2 ts model.

## Running
1. Copy config.example.toml to config.toml, and fill out fields
2. Install dependencies: `npm i`
3. Build it: `npm run build`
4. Run it: `npm run serve`

## FAQ
### When I try to access the admin panel, the server crashes!
You have something called config.toml, boy.
### Why only QEMU? Why not VMWare, VirtualBox, etc.?
VMware is experimental. QEMU is native.
### What platforms can this be run on?
Linux and Windows. NodeJS 18, and Debian's packages are garbage.
### When the VM shuts off, instead of restarting, it freezes.
This has already been fixed by CVM's owners, you are running a copy of this way back in the time.
